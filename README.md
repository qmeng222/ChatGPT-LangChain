## Setup:

1. (For project isolation) create & activate a virtual environment (dependencies are installed within the virtual environment other than system-wide & all subsequent steps will be performed within the virtual environment):
   ```
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
2. Upgrade the pip package manager to the latest version within the current Python environment: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
3. Install libraries/packages:
   - Install the **_openai_** package with a version that is strictly before 1.0.0 (ensuring compatibility with versions before the major release) and the latest version of the **_langchain_** package:
     ```
     pip install "openai<1.0.0" langchain
     pip show openai langchain # display info about the installed packages
     ```
   - Install the python-dotenv library: `pip install python-dotenv`
4. Generate a snapshot of the installed packages and their versions to the requirements.txt file (or overwrite the txt file): `pip freeze > requirements.txt`, so others can install all the packages and their respective versions specified in the requirements.txt file with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the code: `python main.py`
